# STM8 eForth (stm8ef)

[![Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/TG9541/stm8ef.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/TG9541/stm8ef)

STM8 eForth is a very compact interactive Forth system for STM8 µCs. It's much like a tiny operating system with a built-in compiler-interpreter that interacts with the user through a serial console (e.g. using [e4thcom](https://wiki.forth-ev.de/doku.php/en:projects:e4thcom) or a serial terminal). Simple multi-tasking features allow running a control application in the background while tuning parameters (or even change the program!) through the CLI.

The [release](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/releases) provides a library, STM8 register definitions and a plug-in system for board support. Core features include compiling Forth to Flash memory, autostart-operation, and all that's needed for creating a custom Forth core. The release process automatically runs a [self-test in the uCsim STM8S simulator](https://travis-ci.org/TG9541/stm8ef) with Travis-CI.

[![STM8EF Wiki](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5466977/28994765-3267d78c-79d6-11e7-927f-91751cd402db.jpg)](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/wiki)

STM8 eForth is based on [Dr. C.H. Ting's eForth for the *STM8S Discovery*](http://www.forth.org/svfig/kk/07-2010.html). With the kind permission of the original author it has a permissive [FOSS license](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

Forth is a simple but highly extensible [programming language](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/wiki/STM8-eForth-Programming). "Hello World" is as simple as this:

```Forth
: hello ."  Hello World!" ;
```

STM8 eForth is configurable: a full featured binary needs between 4.7K and 5.5K, a basic interactive Forth fits in just 3.5K. The unique `ALIAS` feature provides convenient access to headerless Forth words which enables even more code economy (interactive programming is possible on the smallest STM8 device with 4K Flash memory).

The Forth console works with an STM8 UART, a pair of GPIOs, or even any single GPIO and 3-wire or 2-wire communication (up to two UARTs and a simulated serial interface are supported). The console can be configured at runtime and use any type of [character I/O](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/wiki/STM8-eForth-Board-Character-IO)  (e.g. keyboard and display)!

The [Wiki on GitHub](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/wiki) covers various topics, e.g. using [Breakout Boards](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/wiki/Breakout-Boards), or the conversion of low-cost Chinese thermostats, voltmeters, or DC/DC-converters into Forth powered embedded control boards.

## Generic targets

Generic target binaries are provided as examples and for evaluation:

* STM8S Low Density devices (e.g. STM8S003x3, STM8S103x3, STM8S903x3 or STM8S001J3)

The Wiki lists other supported "[Value Line Gadgets][WG1]", e.g. [voltmeters & power supplies](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/wiki/STM8S-Value-Line-Gadgets#voltmeters-and-power-supplies), [breakout boards](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/wiki/Breakout-Boards), and [thermostats](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/wiki/STM8S-Value-Line-Gadgets#thermostats).

## Other target boards

From STM8 eForth 2.2.24 on, the binary release contains all the files that are necessary for supporting a custom target board. For example, [STM8 eForth MODBUS](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef-modbus) uses the release files to combine target support with the application.
